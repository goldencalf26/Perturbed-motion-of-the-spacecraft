# Perturbed-motion-of-the-spacecraft
A model of the perturbed motion of a small spacecraft in low Earth orbits
Simulation of the perturbed motion of a nanosatellite. The second zonal harmonic and disturbances caused by the influence of the atmosphere are taken into account
Modeling is reduced to solving a system of six differential equations. In this case, the Runge-Kutta method is used by the built-in Matlab function ode45
To determine the effect of the compression of the Earth (the second zonal harmonic) and the atmosphere on the motion of the nanosatellite,
it is necessary to plot the dependence of the radius vector, the longitude of the ascending node, the inclination and the argument of the pericenter on time
